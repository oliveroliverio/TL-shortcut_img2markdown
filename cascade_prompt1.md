I'd to create a shell script that will send an image from the system clipboard to the OpenAI API and return the response in markdown format.  Here's the code from the openAI docs for image input with the prompt already included ("output the contents of the image in markdown format")

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Function to encode the image
def encode_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")


# Path to your image
image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"

# Getting the Base64 string
base64_image = encode_image(image_path)


response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                { "type": "input_text", "text": "what's in this image?" },
                {
                    "type": "input_image",
                    "image_url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}",
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
)

print(response.output_text)
```

The only changes
