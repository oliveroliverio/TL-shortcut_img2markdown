## Added markdown formatting function for better copy-paste experience

**Files Changed:**
- `img2markdown.py`: Added new `prep_for_pasting()` function to format markdown output for better copy-paste experience
  - Converts first level headers (`# Heading`) to third level headers (`### Heading`)
  - Converts second level headers (`## Heading`) to bold text (`**Heading**`)
  - Removes triple backtick markdown designations
  - Modified `main()` function to use this new function when handling output

This change makes the clipboard output ready for direct pasting into existing markdown documents without requiring manual formatting adjustments.

## Added unit test for prep_for_pasting function

**Files Changed:**
- `test_img2markdown.py`: Created new unit test file to verify the functionality of the `prep_for_pasting()` function
  - Test validates that the function correctly:
    - Converts first level headers to third level headers
    - Converts second level headers to bold text
    - Removes triple backtick markdown designations
  - Uses the example markdown provided as test input

The test ensures that the markdown formatting function works as expected with real-world content.

## Rebuilt executable with markdown formatting changes

**Files Changed:**
- `dist/img2markdown`: Rebuilt the executable to incorporate the new `prep_for_pasting()` function
  - The rebuilt executable now properly formats markdown output for easier pasting
  - First level headers are converted to third level headers
  - Second level headers are converted to bold text
  - Triple backtick markdown designations are removed

This update ensures that the standalone executable provides the same improved formatting as the Python script, making it ready for direct pasting into existing markdown documents.
